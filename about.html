      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) strive to address some of the most pressing global issues and 
        promote a better future for all. One of the significant challenges faced by NGOs is to provide education 
        to the uneducated. Furthermore, the existing online platforms come at a cost, which adds an additional 
        hurdle. Therefore, develop a website that offers NGOs a tool to create their websites and a platform to 
        promote their events and activities. Create a solution to assist NGOs in building their online presence 
        and increasing their outreach to raise awareness and garner volunteers to support for their cause. 
      </p>
      <p>The website should be able to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generate webpages for each NGO.</li>
        <li>Create a landing page for each registered NGO.</li>
        <li>Showcase an NGO's previous events and display future events. </li>
        <li>A clean and functional Dashboard to edit the NGO landing page, events and other pages.</li>
        <li>Enable volunteers to register so that NGO can get a list of interested volunteers and communicate with them for future collaborations. </li>
      </ul>
